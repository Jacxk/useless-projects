## Block Jump

This is a minigame, definitely not like Google Chrome's, where you have to jump randomly generated obstacles.

###Controls
* **Arrow Up (or Space):** Jump (the longer you press, the higher you jump).
* **Arrow Down:** Go down faster while in mid air
* **Arrow Left and Arrow Right:** Move to the left or right.
* **R**: Resets the minigame.
